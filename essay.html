					<h1>Essay</h1><br>
					
					<p>In the second semester of 2017 I took the Software engineering paper, it was an interesting experience that taught me many new skills and gave me a lot to reflect on. Overall the team I was put in worked well however the project we were given was fraught with problems and challenges that made progress difficult, despite this it was still very worthwhile and has given me a lot to reflect on. </p>
					
					<p>Communication was a challenge throughout the project. The primary communication tool our group used was Slack, and in reflection I think it was underutilised and not the right tool for the job. The majority of communication happened in person and while being easier verbal communication doesn’t leave any kind of written record which makes looking back on it difficult, however at the same time Slack doesn’t allow you to view the full history of a channel without a paid plan. Overall our methods of communication were functional however they were ineffective at keeping a proper record, and in future I would use a communication tool like IRC that doesn’t hold your message history to ransom. </p>
					
					<p>Being well organised was important and to achieve this we used several tools. To organise our work and to keep track of tasks we created a Trello board and used it to delegate tasks to team members and keep track of completed tasks. Prior to this my only exposure to Trello had been a quick look at it in Professional Practice 1 but it was very easy to use, and I found it very useful to figure out what need to be done and what had already been done. By using organizational tools during my Software Engineering project I learnt the importance of utilizing tools to keep organized and if I was to do this again I would break down tasks into smaller parts as it helps give a sense of progression to larger tasks and leaves a better record of what has been done</p>
					
					<p>Overall the team I was placed in had a very good dynamic and we functioned well together. Usually I prefer to work individually and if I do work in a team I end up either doing all the work or none of it, for example during the spinner project at the beginning of Software Engineering I let one particular team member do everything, whereas during the Programming 4 assignment (which was in groups) I did a large majority of the work. Throughout the project we tackled several problems as a team, one example of this was when we implemented the php lexicon. All the work for this had to be done in class, as we needed to access the OP network, and we all sat around a single computer and worked on it as a group constantly communicating. Reflecting on this it seems like the team was one of the few things that went smoothly in this project.</p>
					
					<p>Once we got access to the C# lexicon there was more of an emphasis on individual work. I took on the task to convert the C# lexicon to Java, most of this was tedious but needed to be done. While I focused on this other team members focused on how the lexicon was deployed (Docker) and finding the Java equivalent to C# libraries. (Specifically looking for a SyntaxWalker) Overall I think this arrangement worked well and I managed to complete a majority of my task, although in reflection I don’t think I used some of the tools I had available as much as I should have, in particular I often neglected the Git repo we had and instead simply compressed my code to a .zip file and uploaded it to the Slack channel. If I did this again I would properly use git more as it keeps a good record of what has been done and makes it easier for my team members to access what I have done.</p>
					
					<p>The seemingly low standard of work performed by the CodeLingo team affected the tasks we were given. Throughout the project the resources we were given by CodeLingo were inadequate making our project more challenging than it had to be. The best example of this was the C# lexicon, this was given to us with no commenting and loosely typed. (until that point I was unaware that it was even possible to have loosely typed C#) This made it very difficult for us as, firstly, we had the menial task of changing all the loosely typed variables and due to the lack of commenting I had only a vague idea what the purpose of the lexicon is, sections of code make sense on their own but all together it was indecipherable. Overall this was a major challenge that hindered us throughout the project, however despite the setbacks I still worked hard to produce something.</p>
					
					<p>Software Engineering wasn’t just the final project, early on we were taught useful skills that are very useful and relevant. During the first few weeks we learnt several new skills involving developing software and managing it. One very useful skill I learnt was the ability to use git in a collaborative environment, in particular the ability to branch a git repo and merge it back together. While I didn’t use this much in the Software Engineering project I used it extensively in the Programming 4 assignment. Overall the skills I learnt in Software Engineering were extremely useful and I will continue to use them throughout this degree and in the outside world.</p>
						
					<p>Doing this project has taught me many important lessons that I will take with me into my third-year project. Before and during the project I didn’t see documenting what had happened and what I had done as very important, I had assumed I would simply be able to remember what had happened. This was a big mistake and resulted in several problems when writing up the technical report, for example I had to recreate what we did to setup the Lingo client in order to accurately record what took place. To make sure this doesn’t happen next year I intend to have a notebook that I record everything in as it happens.</p>
